# Number Separator

This project generates 100 random numbers between 1 and 100,000, separates them into even and odd numbers, and saves them into separate text files inside a folder named `numbers`.

## How it works

- Generates 100 random integers.
- Separates the numbers into two lists: evens and odds.
- Creates (or recreates) a folder called `numbers`.
- Saves the even numbers in `evens.txt`.
- Saves the odd numbers in `odds.txt`.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script `main.py` (or the file name you choose).
3. Check the `numbers` folder for the output files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries only (`random`, `os`, `shutil`).
